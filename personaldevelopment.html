    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p class="styled-text">
    <p>Michael and Charlie, two maintenance men, meet at Mack's Diner after four weeks of not meeting. They meet at the diner, where they sit down to discuss their relationship and how they have been working together since Charlie taught them about gardening. Charlie shares that he started thinking about his relationship with Amy like a gardener, focusing on making time for her and putting more effort into her.

        Michael shares that he has started making time for Amy by taking her to places she wants to go, such as a restaurant, movie, or bookstore. This has been like a ray of sunshine on a flower, and the work isn't over when the color comes out.
        
        Michael's major challenge is work, but he feels like he is not living up to his potential. Charlie asks about his career goals, and Michael admits that he doesn't have any. Charlie explains that he has heard Mr. Davis talk about goal-setting, which he believes is essential for living in a place like Mack's.
        
        Charlie encourages Michael to write down his goals, as it is the key to achieving success in any career. This simple act of goal-setting can help Michael stay focused on his goals and achieve his full potential.</p>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Charlie, a successful swimmer, learns the Pillars of Success from Mr. Davis. He uses his net to stir the water and shakes the contents into a bin. Charlie asks for the next Pillars of Success and is offered to teach them. He decides to surround himself with the best, demonstrating his ability to achieve success.
